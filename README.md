# 12-Rules-For-React-Code---An-antidote-to-chaotic-code

## Case study: Building a complete event calendar list component using

- NextJS
- ReactJS
- TailwindCSS
- JavaScript

In this series we will be discovering 12 rules that will make your React
code and JavaScript code in general far more manageable and beautiful. These
rules are a mix of my own principles, arrived to by natural selection over 25 years of coding experience and things that I have learned from the great coders I have been inspired and mentored by over those same years.

This series will be in _much more depth_ than the average tutorials you will find on the interwebs and YouTube. You will get to see how an expert programmer starts from a mock up and a sample set of data and then proceeds to craft the solution using tried and try programming principles and techniques.

## Organization

I will break the series into episodes that will highlight different rules, and I will be using branches to label each section. Feel free to use the [github issues](https://github.com/DML-Screencasts/12-Rules-For-React-Code---An-antidote-to-chaotic-code/issues) to get general support from the community that came before you.

## Mockup of the design

It should look like this when we are done!
